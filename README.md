# Systems Level Simulator

A systems level simulator that we can test the Avionics teamâ€™s state estimator 
performance, navigational performance, and etc; and use SLS to loop into the test flight data 
to better prepare for the flight day where we attempt to break the record. The use case is 
not limited to just Avionics team. As the simulation achieves high nough fiedelity in transonic 
and supersonic conditions, we can use the simulator as part of the design iteration process.
